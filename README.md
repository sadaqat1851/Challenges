# Java Data Types & Variables Practice

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Java programs and coding challenges designed to help you understand and practice fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, type conversion, arithmetic operations, and user input/output in Java.

## Contents

- **Variables.java**: Demonstrates variable declaration, initialization, and reassignment.
- **TypeConversion.java**: Shows type casting between different primitive types (int, float, byte).
- **Sum.java**: Simple calculator that adds two user-provided numbers.
- **Main.java**: Greets the user and asks for their name and age.
- **Morning.java**: Prints simple patterns using asterisks.
- **DesignPattern.java**: Prints various star patterns (challenges 4, 5, 6).
- **Solution.java**: Reads and prints an integer, double, and string from user input.
- **SynthPasswordFieldU.java**: Contains multiple commented-out code snippets for arithmetic, swapping numbers, and operator practice. Includes a class for multiplying floating-point numbers.
- **Challenge14.java**: Contains commented-out solutions for various challenges, including perimeter, area, interest calculations, and temperature conversion.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (such as VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse) or a text editor

### How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Compile the desired Java file. For example:
   ```powershell
   javac Variables.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled class:
   ```powershell
   java Variables
   ```
5. Repeat for any other file you wish to explore.

### Example
To run the sum calculator:
```powershell
javac Sum.java
java Sum
```
